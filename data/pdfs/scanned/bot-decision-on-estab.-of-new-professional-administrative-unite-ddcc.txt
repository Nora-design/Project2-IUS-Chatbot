THE PROPOSAL OF IUS "DOUBLE DIPLOMA COORDINATION CENTER (DDCC)“

The aim of the Double Diploma Coordination Center (DDCC) proposal is to outline the steps
and successfully implement the requirements of Double Degree Programs which are
established in the existing structure and to clarify the necessary steps and initiatives. The
Double Diploma Coordination Center monitors the processes of required for students to
complete the requirements of two different educational institutions and earn two diplomas
or degrees at the same time. This proposal focuses on the basics of starting and managing a
dual degree training centre.

DEFINITION

The DDCC refers to a organization's structure where a student can obtain two separate
diplomas or degrees from two different educational institutions or systems upon completion
of specific requirements.

The DDCC facilitates partnerships between educational institutions, enabling students to
benefit from the resources, expertise, and curriculum of multiple institutions. These programs
often involve international collaboration, allowing students to gain a broader perspective and
international exposure in their chosen fields.

The specific structure and requirements of a double diploma program can vary depending on
the institutions involved. In some cases, students may need to complete certain coursework
or meet specific criteria to be eligible for the double diploma. The program's duration and
curriculum may also differ based on the institutions' academic policies and agreements. The
DDCC provides the coordinadion of all these processes.

The IUS (International University of Sarajevo) double diploma programs are academic
programs that provide students with the opportunity to obtain two degrees from two different
universities. These programs are typically designed to foster international collaboration and
provide students with a more comprehensive educational experience.

In a double diploma program, students enroll in a specific course of study and complete a
portion of their academic requirements at both IUS and a partner university. The partner
university can be located in another country, allowing students to experience different
educational systems, cultures, and languages.

The double diploma programs offered by IUS usually involve a combination of coursework,
research projects, and internships. Students are required to meet the academic requirements
of both institutions in order to receive both degrees. This may involve fulfilling specific credit
requirements, maintaining a certain GPA, and successfully completing a thesis or research
project. With in this context;

The DDCC is responsible for providing various services and support to students in a university.
Center's primary task is to enhance the overall student experience and promote student
success and well-being. Here are some common tasks and responsibilities of a DDCC:

1. Center Coordinator: This individual will facilitate communication between the partner
institutions, monitor internal end external program progress, and ensure compliance with
accreditation standards.

Ql
2. Student Support: The DDCC will provide guidance and support to students throughout their
academic journey. Center assist students in navigating academic resources, addressing
concerns or challenges, and connecting them with appropriate services.

3. Orientation Programs: The DDCC will organize orientation programs for new students to
help them transition smoothly into double diploma life with the coordination of SAO. These
programs may include academic advising, introductions to support services, campus tours,
and social activities to help students acclimate to their new environment in both countries
with the coordination of SCC (Student & Career Center of US).

4. Program development: DDCC will collaborate with partner institutions to design a
comprehensive curriculum that integrates coursework from both programs. DDCC will ensure
that the curriculum meets the accreditation requirements of both institutions.

5. Crisis Response and Support: In times of emergencies or crises affecting students, such as
academic problems, personal emergencies or natural disasters the DDCC will play a role in
coordinating support with SCC and SAO (Student Affaris Office), providing resources, and
ensuring the well-being of affected students.

VISION AND OBJECTIVES:

e Vision: To provide students with a unique and comprehensive educational experience that
combines the strengths of two educational institutions, enabling them to acquire a
broader skill set and enhance their career prospects.

e Objectives:

a) Develop partnerships with reputable educational institutions to offer double diploma
programs.

b) Ensure program quality and accreditation.

c) Increase student enrollment and retention rates.
